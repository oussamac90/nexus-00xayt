Develop the Nexus Platform, a comprehensive B2B trade facilitation solution.

The platform is targetted at vendors, buyers and shipping operators

**Scope of Work:**  
You will design, build, and deliver a scalable, secure, and user-centric platform, integrating the following core components:

### **Core Features and Functionalities:**

1. **Marketplace Module:**

   - **User Profiles:** Develop robust profiles for buyers and vendors, supporting multiple user roles.

   - **Product and Vendor Discovery:** Implement advanced search and filtering capabilities with AI-powered recommendations.

   - **Product Data Standards:** Integrate **eCl@ss** and **GS1** for structured product data management. Manage the digital catalog using the BMEcat standard.

   - **Order Management:** Build workflows for order placement, tracking, and status updates.

   - **Communication Tools:** Enable secure messaging and file sharing between buyers and vendors.

2. **Trade Intelligence:**

   - **Analytics Dashboard:** Provide insights into market trends, trade flows, and vendor performance.

   - **Prediction Models:** Implement AI-driven models for demand forecasting and opportunity identification.

3. **Shipping Module:**

   - **Logistics Aggregation:** Integrate APIs of logistics providers for transport, warehousing, and tracking.

   - **Real-time Tracking:** Build tools for shipment visibility and status updates.

   - **EDI Integration:** Support **EDIFACT** standards for seamless data exchange between the partners.

4. **Payment Services:**

   - **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate multi-currency and multi-method payment solutions.

   - **Escrow Services:** Implement escrow-like mechanisms to ensure payment security.

   - **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with global financial regulations and security standards (e.g., PCI DSS).

5. **Contract and Legal Management:**

   - **E-Contracts:** Create templates and digital workflows for trade agreements.

   - **Compliance Tools:** Automate compliance checks for cross-border regulations.

   - **Dispute Resolution:** Include mechanisms for recording and addressing trade disputes.

### **Technical Requirements:**

1. **Architecture:**

   - Design the platform using a **microservices architecture** for scalability and modularity.

   - Use **event-driven patterns** for real-time updates and efficient communication between services.

2. **Technology Stack:**

   - Backend: Java with Spring Boot or equivalent.

   - Frontend: Angular or React.

   - Database: PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for NoSQL.

   - Messaging: Kafka for event streaming.

   - Cloud Infrastructure: AWS or Azure for deployment.

3. **Security:**

   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and OAuth2 for authentication and authorization.

   - Encrypt sensitive data using industry standards (e.g., AES-256).

   - Regularly conduct security testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

4. **Performance:**

   - Optimize for high concurrency and low latency.

   - Use caching (e.g., Redis) to enhance response times.

   - Ensure a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

5. **APIs:**

   - Expose REST and GraphQL APIs for integration with third-party tools and services.

   - Document APIs using OpenAPI (Swagger) standards.

6. **Monitoring and Observability:**

   - Include tools for logging, monitoring, and alerting (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana).

   - Implement distributed tracing for debugging microservices.
